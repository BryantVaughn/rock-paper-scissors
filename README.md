### Rock, Paper, Scissors

# Version 1:

A fun rock, paper, scissors console game built for practice working through web development 101 on The Odin Project. (This code is now moved into the archive folder)

# Version 2:

Now has a UI that allows users to interact and play the game without the console open.

# Reflection:

Moving from the console based game to UI based had some challenges in how to restructure code. I found it very helpful to draw everything out on paper to help me understand more of how I needed everything to interact within the game.
